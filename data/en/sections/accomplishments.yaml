- name: 3rd place at SAMSUNG Research ROBOT HACKATHON-2018
  timeline: "December 2018"
  organization:
    name: Samsung Research
    url: https://research.samsung.com
  courseOverview: This competition allowed participants to work with freshly manufactured lines of robots by Samsung. I participated in that competition with an idea called <b>BFF Robot</b> as part of the team <i>SRBD_Hyperbola</i>. The idea was that a robot would become the daily companion of a child, adapting to the child as s/he grows; eventually, the child and the robot would become <i>Best Friends Forever</i>. We secured 3<sup>rd</sup> place among more than 500 teams participating in that contest from all over the world.
