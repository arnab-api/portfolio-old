# a summary about you
summary: '<p align="justify">
            My primary areas of interest in research are <b style="font-family:verdana">Data Science</b>, <b style="font-family:verdana">Computer Vision</b>, and 
            <b style="font-family:verdana">Natural Language Processing</b>. Especially, their application for social good, could be policy design, 
            education, health care, etc.
          </p>
          
          <p align="justify">
            I have limited experience working in the field of <b>Robotics</b>. Recently, I have started learning about 
            <b style="font-family:verdana">Genetic Algorithms</b> and <b style="font-family:verdana">Reinforcement Learning</b> concepts.
          </p>

          <p align="justify">
            If you are an undergraduate student of CSE at SUST (or SEC, or ... ...) and you are considering me as a mentor 
            for your final year project/thesis (or CSE350), please checkout this 
            <a href=/files/research%20ideas_by%20API.txt target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b style="color:#00004d; font-family:verdana"><i>LIST OF POTENTIAL PROJECTS</i></b></a>.
            Pardon the rude <i>.txt</i> file. The list is merely a reflection of my semi-organized thoughts on potential research projects 
            and I intend to update it frequently. This is by no means an exhaustive list.
          </p>

          <p align="justify">
            I am always open to join new collaborations. If you are a researcher working in Data Science, Machine Learning related 
            projects, and believe I could assist you with something, please do not hesitate to contact me.
          </p>
